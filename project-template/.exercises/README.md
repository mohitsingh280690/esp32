# Exercise Templates and Completed Solutions

This directory stores your progress through the learning exercises.

## Directory Structure

```
.exercises/
├── README.md              ← You are here
├── completed/             ← Your finished exercise code (auto-saved)
│   ├── day1-ex1-code-analysis.cpp
│   ├── day1-ex2-arduino-comparison.cpp
│   └── day1-ex3-logging-levels.cpp
└── templates/             ← Starting templates (optional reference)
    └── day2-ex1-two-tasks.cpp
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Backups

When you complete an exercise and move to the next:
1. AI instructor backs up your current `src/main.cpp`
2. Saved as `completed/day#-ex#-descriptive-name.cpp`
3. New template loaded into `src/main.cpp` for next exercise

### Completed Solutions

Your completed exercises are preserved here for:
- **Reference** - Review previous solutions
- **Portfolio** - Show your learning progress
- **Comparison** - See how you've improved

### Templates

Optional starting templates for exercises. You may:
- Use them as reference
- Start from scratch
- Ask AI instructor for guidance

## Workflow

**You always work in:** `src/main.cpp`

**After each exercise:**
1. Type "ready for review" or "next exercise"
2. AI saves your work to `completed/`
3. New template loads into `src/main.cpp`
4. You continue in the same file

**No folder switching needed!**

## File Naming Convention

Format: `day#-ex#-topic-name.cpp`

Examples:
- `day1-ex1-code-analysis.cpp`
- `day2-ex2-task-parameters.cpp`
- `day3-ex4-task-suspension.cpp`

## Tips

- Keep this directory in your project (it's ignored by git if needed)
- Review completed exercises before exams/assessments
- Compare early vs later code to see improvement
- Use as reference when building real projects
