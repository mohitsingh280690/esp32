# Learning Progress Tracker

**Start Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Target Completion:** January 13, 2026 (4 weeks)  
**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Board:** ESP32 WROOM  
**Workspace:** `e:\esp32-freertos-tutorial-main\project-template`

## 📁 How This Works

**Single Workspace Approach:**
- You work in ONE project throughout all exercises
- Your code is always in `src/main.cpp`
- Previous solutions saved in `.exercises/completed/`
- No switching folders = No lost context!

**Exercise Flow:**
1. I backup your current work
2. I give you new template with TODOs
3. You code in `src/main.cpp`
4. You test with `pio run -t upload`
5. Type "ready for review" when done
